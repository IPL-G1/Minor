This project is mainly designed to analyze and extract some important information from IPL dataset. We will calculate the probability
between toss winning and match winning. K-means algorithm will be used to create a cluster of players(batsman and bowlers) depending on
various factors like bowling speed, maximum wicket takers ,average score, run rate, away or home games etc. Keeping in mind the result of
clusters, the budget of the team and preference of players we can select a really good team at the time of team selection or players auction and
hence the results can be improved. The purpose behind analysing all this data is to improve the game, and take it to the next level
